# employee-tracker

## Description

This command-line application was designed to manage a company's employee database. 

You may view the the walkthru video that demonstrates the application's functionality by [clicking this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hqWwyAE9S68q6YcNSzm2foPLz_1JscXC/view).


**Technologies**  

The application was created by Node JS with the `Inquirer` and `MySQL2` and `console.table` packages.

**Criteria**

***User Story***
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business

***Acceptance Criteria***
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role

WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids

WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role

WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to

WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database

WHEN I choose to add a role
THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database

WHEN I choose to add an employee
THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database

WHEN I choose to update an employee role
THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database

**Accomplishment**
The application successfully allows a user to interact with the datasbe as required, with the following exceptions:
- The option to create a new role is not yet working, as the new role does not print to the table, as intended;
- the option to update an employee's data has not been added yet, dut to time constraints 
These will be added in version 1.1 of the app.
